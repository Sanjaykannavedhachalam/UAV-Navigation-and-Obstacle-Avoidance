# UAV-Navigation-and-Obstacle-Avoidance
This repository contains working implementations of cutting-edge algorithms and techniques for obstacle avoidance in Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). These algorithms are designed to enhance UAV navigation by detecting and avoiding obstacles in real-time using a combination of neural networks and traditional computer vision methods.
